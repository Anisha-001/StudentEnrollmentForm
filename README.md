<h2> Key Features:</h2>
<h6> 1.Primary Key: The form uses Roll No as the primary key. It checks if the Roll No exists in the database before enabling the appropriate buttons.<br>
2. Button Logic:
If Roll No exists, the Update button is enabled, allowing the user to update student data.
If Roll No does not exist, the Save button is enabled, allowing the user to add new student data.<br>
3. Field Validation: Ensures all fields are filled before saving or updating data.<br>
4. Form Reset: The Reset button clears the form and reverts it to its initial state.<br>
5. Database Interaction: The code interacts with the database through a mock API endpoint. You'll need to replace the database check and interaction with a real database API.</h6>
